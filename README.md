# ImpossibleArcade
## Semester-Project for CS321

The goal of this project is to design a series of arcade games with AI that are extremely challenging to beat using reinforcement learning. Music in each game is novely generated based on interaction with the game environment, making each experience unique (more so an excuse to play creepy music).

Team: Sam, Joe, Megan, Matthias
